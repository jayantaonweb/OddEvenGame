# Odd Even Game Project

## Overview
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based Odd Even Game developed using **Java Swing**. It replicates the traditional Odd Even game with interactive elements and enhanced user experience. The game is designed with multiple phases, and multithreading is utilized for efficient handling of user inputs and game events.

## Features
- **GUI Design**: Interactive interface with buttons, labels, and text areas.
- **Game Logic**: Implements the core mechanics of the traditional Odd Even game.
- **Game Phases**: 
  - Toss Phase: Determine the player's toss result.
  - Game Phase: Player selects odd or even and plays against the system.
  - Result Phase: Displays the winner and game outcome.
- **Game History**: Tracks the history of previous games.
- **Restart Functionality**: Players can restart the game at any time.
- **Display Rules**: Game rules are accessible to the player.
- **Multithreading**: Ensures smooth handling of user inputs and game state transitions.

## How to Play
1. **Toss Phase**: The player participates in a toss to determine who will go first.
2. **Game Phase**: The player chooses either Odd or Even and competes against the system.
3. **Result Phase**: The game announces the result of the match.
4. **Restart Game**: Players can choose to play again.

## Skills Demonstrated
- GUI Design using **Java Swing**.
- Core **Java programming** for game logic.
- **Multithreading** to handle user inputs and manage game events.
- Development of a **Game Application** with multiple states.

## Technology Stack
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Java Swing**: Used for building the graphical user interface.

## How to Run the Game
### Using .exe (Windows):
1. Download the executable file from the [OddEvenGame.exe][(link-to-your-exe-file)](https://github.com/jayantaonweb/OddEvenGame/blob/main/OddEvenGame.exe).
2. **JDK Requirement**: Ensure that JDK 17 or higher is installed on your system. If you don't have the JDK, you can download the version bundled with the executable in the ZIP file below.
3. Run the `.exe` file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

### Using the ZIP File with Portable JDK:
1. Download the `.zip` file containing the portable JDK and the executable from the [OddEvenGame_JDK.zip][(link-to-your-zip-file)](https://github.com/jayantaonweb/OddEvenGame/releases/download/v1.0/OddEvenGame.zip).
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file.
3. Navigate to the extracted folder and run the `.exe` file. No need to install the JDK separately.
